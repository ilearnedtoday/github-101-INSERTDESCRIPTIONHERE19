# Git & GitHub Assignment
From the notes and materials provided i was able to understand the following about Git & GitHub;
- Git itself is a distributed Version Control System used for tracking changes in code, collaborating and sharing. Git allows you to track changes you make to your projects ensuriing you have records on what you have worked on so that you can easily revert back to past work if need be.
- Git makes working with other people easy, allowing groups of people to work together on the same project merging their changes into one fial source.
- GitHub on the other hand is in some sense a way to use the power of Git online with an easy to use interface, GitHub is used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain project history.
- GitHub is home to most advanced technologies in the world.
  ## Terms used in GitHub
  Below are some of the terms in GitHub that i have read about, i can't say i fully understand them but with time i will and i'll further study them to gain keen understanding in all of them.
#### REPOSITORIES :
-  This is where a project/ work happens, you can think of it as a folder that contains all your projects files and revision history. a repository can be used individually or with others you choose to collaborate with on those files.
#### CLONING :
-  Repositories when created are stored within the cloud, cloning is when you create a local copy of the repository on your computer, Git is used to sync the two.
-  Cloning makes it easier to fix issues, add/ removes files, push large commits, etc.
-  Cloning also allows you to use editing tools of your choice as opposed to the GitHub UI.
  #### COMMITING AND PUSHING :
-  This is how you add changes you made on your local machine to the remote repository in GitHub.
-  A commit can be called a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.
-  Commits help keep track of changes made to your code over time.
-  A push is the process of uploadiing your local commits to a remote repository, this is how you share your code with others/ synchronize your local changes with a central repository.
-  Pushing is essential for collaborating on code with others.
-  This allows your instructor/ teammates to see your latest work when you're readyto share.
-  Commits are made when you make changes to your project that you want to "checkpoint".
-  You are also able to add a helpful commit message reminding you and your teammates what work you did.  
#### Branches :
-  A branch is a seperate line of development within a repository, works like a copy of your project where you are able to make changes that won't affect the main project.
-  They help maintain code quality and stability.
-  Allows you to develop features, fix bugs and safely experiment new ideas in a contained area of yoour repository.
#### FORKS :
-  A fork is another way to copy a repository, fork is usually used when you are contributing to someone else's project.
-  Allows you to try out new ideas without affecting the original project.
-  Forks allow you to create your own version of an open source project and propose changes back to the main project.
#### PULL REQUESTS :
-  This is known as a way to propose a change to a repository, this is done by requesting for your changes to be merged into another branch.
-  Allows multiple people to review your code for quality, efficiency and potential issues.
-  Provides a clear record of changes and the review process.
-  Pull requests help maintain code quality and consistency.
#### ISSUES :
-  Issues can be called a to-do list for your project, they are used to track bugs, feature requests, and any other items that need attention.
-  Issues can also be used to point out bugs you find/ features you think would be a great add to some open source projects.

  # Areas i'm still not clear on  
-  The whole "markdown" thing is still quite confusing, some commands don't make sense to me yet but with time i will get the hang of it.
-  Engaging with others is still a bit complicated to me but i will begin practicing on that in due time.
-  Creating repositories is also confusing, maybe it's because i still don't understand certain terms.

  with this i come to the end of my POV of Git and GitHub, thanks for reading.
